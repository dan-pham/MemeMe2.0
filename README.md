# Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree - MemeMe2.0 App
This repository contains the MemeMe2.0 app from Udacity's UIKit Fundamentals course. This app builds upon MemeMe1.0 and introduces a 
UITabBarController to switch between a UICollectionView and a UITableView.

## Overview
MemeMe2.0 allows users to view previously created memes in either a table format or a collection format. Selecting a meme opens it
in a new view to allow the user to see the entire meme in better detail.
